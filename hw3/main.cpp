// I will call the employee with no boss a supreme boss
// Each employee has only one or no boss
// 1. If the employee has no boss, he is the supreme boss
// 2. If the employee has one boss, he also has only one supreme boss, and that is either his boss, or his boss's boss (since his boss can only have one boss), or his boss's boss's boss, and so on
// 3. An employee cannot have more than one boss
// No employee is their own boss, not even inderectly, and each employee has only one boss <=> graph of employees has no cycles <=> graph is a forest
// I do not know if every graph of employees given is connected, so I will assume the worst; it is not, and thus graph is not a tree, but only a forest
// However, each connected component is by definition connected, and since the original graph has no cycles, it's connected components also have no cycles
// So, each connected component is a tree
// My algorithm will first divide the graph into trees, and then will compute the minimal sum coloring for each tree.
// The minimal sum coloring for a tree is correct
